            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India is a rapidly developing country which needs a change in all its systems and sectors mainly the education system for its betterment in a long run which needs priority investments and concessions.     The education system plays a major role in structuring the future generation of India whilst still a vast majority of people believe change as a 'strange' phenomenon consequently refusing to accept a mentality of thinking ahead. This seriously affects economic growth, decreases competitiveness and increases unemployment.  Recent studies suggest that there has been drastic improvement in the economic system in countries which chose to improve its educational systems. Concentrating on important issues than on the least and to bring out mature ideas by shifting from a constrained resource mindset to feeding unconstrained ambitions. It requires changes in the social goals, objectives and values which directly affect the education system and social interaction.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Indian education history is very rich and motivating. In the ancient days, gurus and scholars impart education orally, but after the development of letters, it took the form of writing. Palm leaves and barks of trees were used for teaching, and this in turn helped in spreading of the written literature. Temples and community centres often took the role of school. When Buddhism spread in India, education become available to everyone and this was the time when some world famous educational institutions were established like Nalanda, Vikramshila and Takshashila. History has taken particular care to give Nalanda University, which flourished from the fifth to 13th century AD, full credit for its brilliance. This university had around 10,000 resident students and teachers on its roll at one time. These students included Chinese, Sri Lankan, Korean and other international scholars. It requires changes in the social goals, objectives and values which directly affect the education system and social interaction.</p>
